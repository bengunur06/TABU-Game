# TABU-Game
i coded this game to play with my roomates words are personalized acccording to me and my roomates humor .
someone who understand the code can change the words to whatever they like 

### ISSUE
i tried to make scanf wait for 30 second but i could't find a function or a way to do it 
if you suggest sleep function i have tried that but it doesn't effect scanf function 
i want scanf to wait for maximum  20 second to get the input if the input is not given then the player gets negative point 
anyone who has any idea how to do that plese make a commit or suggestion to me 

### compiling 
`$ gcc tabu.c `
